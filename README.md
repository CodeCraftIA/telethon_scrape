# telethon_scrape
Script that scraped participants of public groups, and messages

Replace api_id and api_hash with your Telegram API credentials. Obtain these credentials by creating a new application at Telegram's development platform.
Create a text file named channels.txt and list all the group or channel handles you want the script to scrape. Each handle should be on a new line.

# Usage
The script performs two main functions: scraping participants and scraping messages.

# Notes
Ensure you have appropriate permissions and access rights to scrape from the specified Telegram channels or groups.
Modify the scripts to fit your specific scraping requirements, such as increasing message limits or adding more data fields.
